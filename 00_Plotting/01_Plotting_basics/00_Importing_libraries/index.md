### Matplotlib.pyplot

One of the most important aspects of python is the ability to take work that has already been done, and re-use it.  In our case, we are going to be using a **library** that was created specifically for plotting in python.  This means that _every time_ that we want to plot, we will need to import this library.  Below is a _very_ basic script that just imports the library that we are going to be using.

For every script in this course we will always be importing _**matplotlib.pyplot**_


As well, we don't want to have to type matplotlib.pyplot every time that we want to reference the library, so we also give it a pseudonym and call it plt.  This means that any time that we want to use this specific library, we can reference it directly by calling it _plt_.  See more below for a specific example!



```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```


In addition, we can import other libraries which might be useful to us.  In general, **numpy** tends to be very nice as it allows mathematical operations with vectors, so you may hear me reference this commonly as well.
