### Welcome to EXL skills!
#### Learn to create beautiful plots with python!

In this class we will be covering plotting with python.  This subject has a lot of nuances and we will not be cover all the topics here, but at the very least, you should be able to walk away from this course feeling as though you have the ability to easily plot and express your ideas using python code.  

We will be using a built in IDE but in the future if you want to work locally on your own machine, I would highly recommend looking into out **Digital Diploma** series where we set up a computer for you to code on directly.

On the next page, I will introduce our IDE and how it is used!
